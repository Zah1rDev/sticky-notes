The Sticky Note Wall

The Sticky Note Wall is a work in progress website, destined to be a fun art hosting plattform with an interesting gimmick:
every piece uploaded has to be in square ratio, and preferably drawn by hand on a sticky note of any brand.
Afterwards, depending on the art's proximity to the borders of the site,
it will get added horizontally or vertically to a grid of other submissions,
therefore forming a "wall", of purely sticky note art.

The idea came from a project I'm currently working on, where I draw things in this particular format, to then post them
next to each other in one of my classrooms' walls.

You can access the current state of the website from: https://zah1rdev.github.io/sticky-notes/
